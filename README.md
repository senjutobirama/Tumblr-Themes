# Tumblr-Themes

You may lightly edit the theme to your liking. I only ask that you do not remove
my credit or use it as a base code. I do have a base code if you want to make your own.

Do not remove the credit from my codes. You may change the icon/text,
or move it at a different visible location of your blog.

I go under numerous blog usernames. There won't be a broken link.

LET ME KNOW about broken links on my theme page/original posts.

Like and reblog my themes! The like to reblog ratio hinders coders from creating
more awesome themes for you. A reblog is like a shoutout from everybody.
It keeps us going!
